The contest is over!  Host it yourself :)

Decision engine written in Minecraft

This project was written for the OMGWTF2 contest.  It is a shout-out to all the nephews who write "enterprise"
software for their uncles, and invariably produce code that's written in the most obtuse way possible.
http://omg2.thedailywtf.com/


It works like this:

The ASP.Net MVC 4 application hosts a minecraft (java) process in global.asax.cs.  This 
variable is shared with the rest of the application using HttpContext.Current.Application[""].

ASP.Net MVC 4 application (with some WTFs of it's own) receives a request for /decision

The MVC4 application asks the host application (via HttpContext.Current.Application[""]) to begin the
decision-making process.

The Host process sends commands via STDIN to minecraft.

Minecraft detects the incoming command and kicks off a not-so-elaborate (have you SEEN some of the redstone stuff 
people make?) redstone circuit to determine the outcome of the decision.  Command blocks at the end of the decision
circuit sends a "/say ..." command to voice steve's opinion on the decision.

The Host process detects the command via STDERR (someone else's wtf...) and raises an event back to the MVC process.

The MVC process sends the resulting decision back to the caller.



This entire process is wrapped up in a nice, but useless, 3D rendered (WebGL/Three.js) web page that shows a render of
the minecraft world that's running the RNG logic.  Please use Chrome to view the web page.  It uses AJAX to
communicate with the MVC 4 services.


I am hosting both the web application and the minecraft server locally, accessible to the internet for the duration of
the contest.  Judges are welcome, and if you don't have a minecraft account (so you can see the action) I have a spare
one you can borrow.

(The system requires a user be logged into the server whenever decisions are requested.  Otherwise the redstone won't
run and the whole thing will time out (default timeout response is "YES")).  To address this, I have a local process
that keeps a minecraft client up and running, connected to the server.  It detects when the server is restarted, and
restarts the client after a server restart.
